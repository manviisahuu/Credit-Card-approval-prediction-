# Credit Card Approval Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a credit card application being approved based on various features such as income, age, education, employment status, marital status, and others. The goal is to provide insights that can be used by financial institutions to streamline their credit approval process.

**Project Description**
The project is built using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for machine learning model training. The model uses both Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict whether a given credit card application is likely to be approved or rejected based on the provided inputs.

*Features:*
* User can input personal details such as income, age, marital status, education, children, etc.
* The app predicts whether the credit card application will be approved or rejected based on the input features.
* The project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for prediction.
* Confetti effect on approval for a fun interaction when the user is approved.

# Business Insights Based on Analysis:
* Customers with an annual income above â‚¹2 lakh are more likely to get their credit applications approved.
* Most users fall between the 30-60 years age group, which has a higher approval rate.
* People who are working or state servants have a higher approval rate compared to students and pensioners.
* Customers with Higher Education have better approval chances, whereas those with Secondary/Secondary Special education face more rejections.
* Married customers have a higher approval rate.
* Especially married customers with no children tend to get approved easily, possibly due to lower financial responsibilities.
* Female customers have higher rejection rates compared to males, although income levels are somewhat similar across genders.
* People working as Managers and Laborers have higher approval rates compared to other professions.

*Technologies Used:*
Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit)
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering)
Visualization (Streamlit for UI, Matplotlib/Seaborn for charts)
